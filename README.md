# Data Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Using Python

This repository is a place to share my code and notebooks for data science project.

This project using the BBC sports dataset and performs K-Means clustering using Euclidean Distance and Cosine Distance. It also visualizes the cluster centres using Tag cloud using Python package WordCloud. 

Dimensionality reduction is performed using PCA and captured variance is plotted with respect to increasing latent dimensionality.
